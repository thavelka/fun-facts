Press a button, see a new fact.

My first Android application and the product of another great tutorial by Team Treehouse.
I can't claim the rights to this design or idea.

By creating this app, I have learned:
* Android app file structure
* MVC design principles using Java classes, Views, and Activities.
* How to push an app to an Android emulator or debugging device
* How to edit view styles using XML
* How to interact with buttons using OnClickListeners
